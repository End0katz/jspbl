Java String Parsing Blob Library
================================
Library for parsing strings in java. Not much more to it.  


If you expect the jokes in this paragraph to be good, you may wish to leave.  
For allergen information, see words after those **in** bold.  
Made by blobs, for blobs, **of** code, because I wanted a java string parsing library.
May **contain** code written by **some** random blob, as well **as** ternary operators.
If you are not comfortable with more than 50 violations of good java practice in one file, I suggest you find some other random git repo to parse strings with. Or a library, I hear those are cool.
